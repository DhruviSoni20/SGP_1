    <h1 class="p1">Our Story</h1>
    <p>We started as a group of like minded people who didn't have many connections but were always curious and eager to be part of everything interesting. This is a student organization at Sweven university dedicated to helping introverted and reserved students to stay informed. 
      We provide all details and news regarding technical, non-technical and cultural events, clubs, and co-curricular activities.
